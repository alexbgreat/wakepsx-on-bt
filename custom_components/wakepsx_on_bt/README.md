Wake up your PlayStation (PS3, PS4, PS5) from Home Assistant over Bluetooth.

The integration impersonates your paired DualShock/DualSense controller using a low-level Bluetooth HCI wake packet. Two wake methods are supported:

| Method | Description | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **ESPHome** | A dedicated ESP32 handles Bluetooth and stays always available. No system-level constraints, works reliably in automations. | ✅ Strongly recommended |
| **Bluetooth Dongle** | A USB Bluetooth adapter plugged directly into your HA host. Requires raw HCI access and a dedicated adapter. | Fallback when no ESP32 is available |

---

## Prerequisites

### Both methods

- A **paired DualShock 3**, **DualShock 4**, or **DualSense** controller
- Either:
  - A **USB data cable** to connect the controller to your HA host during setup (one-time only), with USB passthrough enabled (Home Assistant OS, Supervised, or Container); **or**
  - A Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge) on the device you're using to complete setup, to read the MAC addresses via **WebHID** instead — see [WebHID extraction](#webhid-extraction-no-usb-passthrough-needed) below

### ESPHome method

- An **ESP32 with Classic Bluetooth** — see [Compatible Hardware](../../esphome/README.md#compatible-hardware)
- The **ESPHome** add-on or standalone CLI to compile and flash the firmware

### Bluetooth Dongle method

- A USB Bluetooth adapter with a **compatible chipset**
- The adapter must be within Bluetooth range of the console (~10 metres)

→ See [pywakepsx-on-bt](https://github.com/FreeTHX/pywakepsx-on-bt) for the full chipset compatibility list and support ratings.

## Installation

### ESPHome method

1. Flash the ESP32 firmware — see [esphome/README.md](../../esphome/README.md).
2. Copy the `wakepsx_on_bt` folder into your HA `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Bluetooth Dongle method

1. Copy the `wakepsx_on_bt` folder into your HA `custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

Home Assistant automatically installs all required dependencies on restart. The Bluetooth layer is powered by [pywakepsx-on-bt](https://github.com/FreeTHX/pywakepsx-on-bt).

## Bluetooth Dongle — Usage Recommendations

> **The ESPHome method is strongly recommended for automations and repeated use.** The Dongle method involves low-level OS operations that carry hardware-specific constraints described below.

The Dongle method sends the wake packet by temporarily spoofing the Bluetooth adapter's MAC address via a raw HCI socket. This works reliably in most setups, but involves constraints that the ESPHome method avoids entirely:

- **Use a dedicated adapter.** Do not use an adapter already managed by Home Assistant's native Bluetooth integration. Sharing an adapter between HA Bluetooth and this integration causes conflicts: HA's stack holds the device open, and BD_ADDR spoofing is incompatible with a running host stack.
- **A dedicated USB dongle is the cleanest solution.** A compatible USB Bluetooth adapter (~5€) plugged in alongside your existing setup avoids any conflict.
- The config flow automatically flags adapters already managed by HA (marked ⚠ Not recommended).
- **⚠ Experimental — concurrent access and recovery timing.** The integration serialises access to the Bluetooth adapter using an internal lock and reports "Busy" if a wake sequence is already in progress. After each sequence, a short recovery window is enforced to allow the adapter to reinitialise. This mechanism is functional but **experimental**: timing behaviour varies between chipsets and host systems. If you trigger the button in rapid succession, the second press may be silently dropped or return a "Busy" state. **Wait at least 3–5 seconds between attempts.** Using two console entries that share the same adapter increases the risk of conflict.
- **Some chipsets reset after a wake sequence.** On certain adapters (Broadcom, CSR, Intel, Cypress), the BD_ADDR restore triggers an HCI Reset, which may cause the USB device to briefly disconnect and re-enumerate. During this window the adapter is temporarily unavailable. The integration attempts to absorb this delay, but if the adapter takes longer than expected to recover, the next wake attempt will fail with a timeout error. Unplug and replug the dongle to recover immediately.
- **Raw HCI access is required.** The HA process must have `CAP_NET_RAW` / `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges. On HA OS and Supervised, this is granted automatically. On Container setups, ensure the container has the necessary permissions.

## Configuration

1. Plug your paired PlayStation controller into the USB port of your HA host. *(Controller must be off before plugging in.)*
2. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
3. Search for **Wake PSX on Bluetooth**.
4. **Step 1:** The integration reads the MAC addresses from the USB controller automatically. No USB access on the HA host? Tick **Enter manually** instead and use the [WebHID tool](#webhid-extraction-no-usb-passthrough-needed).
5. **Step 2:** Choose your wake method and console name.
6. **Step 3 (ESPHome):** Select your ESPHome node from the list.
   **Step 3 (Dongle):** Select your Bluetooth adapter from the list.
7. Unplug the controller. Done.

A **Button** entity is created for the console. The entity ID is derived from the console name — for example, `button.my_ps5_wake` for a console named "My PS5". Find the exact ID in **Developer Tools → States**.

## WebHID extraction (no USB passthrough needed)

If your Home Assistant host doesn't have (or can't be given) USB access to the controller — a Docker host with no `--device` passthrough, a locked-down NAS, HA Cloud, etc. — Step 1 also offers a browser-based alternative that reads the two MAC addresses directly in your own browser, using the [WebHID API](https://wicg.github.io/webhid/), instead of on the HA server.

1. On Step 1 of the setup wizard, open the linked WebHID tool (served by HA itself at `/api/wakepsx_on_bt/webhid/extractor.html`).
2. Plug the controller into **the computer or phone you're using right now**, not the HA host.
3. Click **Connect Controller** and pick it from the browser's device picker.
4. Copy the two MAC addresses it displays.
5. Back in the setup wizard, tick **Enter manually**, submit, then paste the MAC addresses and pick the controller type.

Requirements and limitations:

- **Browser support:** Chrome, Edge, or another Chromium-based browser. WebHID is not implemented in Firefox or Safari.
- **Secure context:** the page must be loaded over HTTPS (e.g. via Nabu Casa or a reverse proxy with a certificate) — plain `http://homeassistant.local:8123` will not expose `navigator.hid`. As a workaround, the extractor page has no server dependency once downloaded, so it can also be saved locally and opened directly as a `file://` URL, which browsers also treat as a secure context.
- This only replaces the one-time MAC address extraction in Step 1. The **Bluetooth Dongle** wake method still requires raw HCI (`CAP_NET_RAW`/`CAP_NET_ADMIN`) access on the HA host itself — WebHID cannot substitute for that.

## Entity Attributes

After each wake attempt the button exposes its result as attributes:

| Attribute | Example values |
|---|---|
| `last_wake_status_text` | `Ready`, `Success`, `Page Timeout`, `Task Error` |
| `last_wake_result` | `ready`, `success`, `timeout`, `error` |
| `last_wake_method` | `esphome_psx_waker`, `bluetooth_dongle` |

The status resets to `Ready` automatically after 5 seconds.

## Troubleshooting

### ESPHome method

- **ESPHome node not found during setup:** Make sure the ESP32 is online and already discovered by the ESPHome integration in HA before running the setup.
- **Page Timeout:** The ESP32 is too far from the console, or the console's Bluetooth is asleep. Move the ESP32 closer or wake the console manually once.
- **Firmware compilation fails:** Confirm you are using an `esp32dev` board with the ESP-IDF framework (not Arduino). See [esphome/README.md](../../esphome/README.md).

### Bluetooth Dongle method

- **No compatible adapter detected:** Check that the adapter is plugged in and recognised by the OS. Run `hciconfig` to list available adapters.
- **Adapter flagged as ⚠ Not recommended:** The adapter is already managed by HA's Bluetooth integration. Use a dedicated dongle instead.
- **Page Timeout:** The adapter is too far from the console. Move it closer or use an extension cable to reposition it.
- **Detection error:** HA may not have the permissions to open a raw HCI socket. Check that the HA process has `CAP_NET_RAW` / `CAP_NET_ADMIN` or is running as root.

### Both methods

- **USB Extraction Failed / No Controller Found:** Use a data cable (not charge-only). Check that your HA host OS allows USB device access (udev rules on custom Linux hosts). Alternatively, use the [WebHID tool](#webhid-extraction-no-usb-passthrough-needed) and tick **Enter manually** — this avoids USB passthrough on the HA host entirely.
- **WebHID tool shows "not available in this browser":** Use Chrome or Edge, and make sure the page is loaded over HTTPS or opened as a local `file://` page — WebHID requires a secure context and isn't implemented in Firefox/Safari.
